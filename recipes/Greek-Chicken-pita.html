    <h3>Recipe: </h3>
    <ul>
        <h4>Chicken</h4>
        <li>1 lb of chicken breast</li>
        <li>1 cup of plain greek yogurt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon of oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of paprika</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, <em>minced</em></li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of onion powder</li>


    </ul>
    <h3>Steps: </h3>
    <ol>
        
        <li>Add chicken and balsamic vinaigrette to a bowl, cover and transfer to the refrigerator. Allow the chicken to marinate for at least four hours or overnight. In a separate small bowl, combine the Greek yogurt, chopped cucumber and onion, minced parsley, lime juice, minced garlic, salt and pepper. Mix well and chill until serving.</li>
        <li>Preheat your grill. Remove the chicken from the marinade and discard the marinade. When the grill is hot, lightly oil the grill rack. Grill the chicken, covered, over medium heat, four to seven minutes per side. If you don’t have a grill, broil the chicken 4 inches from the heat source for the same amount of time. Cook until a thermometer reads 165°F.</li>
        <li>Allow the chicken to rest for a few minutes, then cut it into strips. Fill each pita half with chicken, cucumber, tomato, onion and cheese. Finish with a drizzle of the cucumber sauce.</li>
    </ol>
